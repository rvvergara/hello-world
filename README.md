# hello-world

Hello world! Im a mechanical engineer learning computer science/programming/web-development. This is my first GitHub repository and hopefully I will make lots of awesome apps that will benefit a lot of people. 

As part of learning, I edited this file in vim in Git in my local machine and then pushed it back to my remote repo. Cool!

I added yet again a new line to practice what I learned
